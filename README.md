# ðŸŒŠ TinyDrop

**TinyDrop** is a transparent micro-donation platform where even â‚¹1 can create real impact.

Donors can contribute small amounts, which are pooled together to take meaningful actions like feeding the needy. Once the target amount is reached, the action is performed and proof (image, note, or location) is shared with all contributors.

TinyDrop ensures complete transparency by tracking every rupee from donation to impact.

> One drop may be small, but together, we create a wave of change.
